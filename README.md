## Deployed on Firebase
https://restaurant-menu-864bd.web.app/

## Description
* Created a Simple Restaurant Menu App using basic knowledge of React. (Day 16 of #100daysofcode)
* Implemented State Management to add Category Filters.
* New Categories and Items can be added in MenuApi.js 
* Added logic to automatically recognize each new category and add it in tab bar. (including Custom Items)
* Deployment on Firebase. 
* Not Mobile Responsive Yet. 

## Firebase Deployment Steps:
1. firebase init
2. select hosting
3. select existing firebase project folder
4. build folder instead of public
5. npm run build (do not do it before)
6. firebase deploy

If you make any changes then : 

7. no need to worry
8. (firebase wont automatically capture it until you connect it to github)(optional)
9. (it can be connected to github only if initialized first)(optional)
10. now again do NPM RUN BUILD
11. then FIREBASE DEPLOY
12. It will deploy the new code to firebase.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
